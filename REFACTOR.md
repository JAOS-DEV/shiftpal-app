## ✨ Rule Compliance Checklist

For each component, ensure:

- [ ] **Component Length:** < 150 lines (flexible to 200 for complex components)
- [ ] **Explicit Return Types:** All functions have `: ReturnType`
- [ ] **StyleSheet.create:** No inline style objects

- [ ] **Interfaces over Types:** For object shapes
- [ ] **Named Exports:** Prefer named over default
- [ ] **Single Responsibility:** One clear purpose per component
- [ ] **Effect Cleanup:** All useEffect hooks clean up properly
- [ ] **FlatList for Lists:** Don't manually map long arrays in JSX

---

## 📝 Notes

- Some components may exceed 150 lines if they're cohesive and under 200 lines
- Priority is maintainability and readability over strict line counts
- Test after each major refactor to ensure functionality is preserved
- Update this file as tasks are completed
